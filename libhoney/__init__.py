'''libhoney is a library to allow you to send events to Honeycomb from within
your python application.

Basic usage:

- initialize libhoney with your Honeycomb writekey and dataset name
- create an event object and populate it with fields
- send the event object
- close libhoney when your program is finished

Sending on a closed or uninitialized libhoney will throw a `libhoney.SendError`
exception.

You can find an example demonstrating usage in example.py'''

    '''Initialize libhoney and prepare it to send events to Honeycomb. This creates
    a global Client object that is configured with the supplied parameters. For some
    advanced used cases, you might consider creating a Client object directly, but
    `init` is the quickest path to getting data into Honeycomb.

    Note that libhoney initialization initializes a number of threads to handle
    sending payloads to Honeycomb. Be mindful of where you're calling
    `libhoney.init()` in order to ensure correct enqueueing + processing of
    events on the spawned threads.

    Args:

    - `writekey`: the authorization key for your team on Honeycomb. Find your team
            write key at [https://ui.honeycomb.io/account](https://ui.honeycomb.io/account)
    - `dataset`: the name of the default dataset to which to write
    - `sample_rate`: the default sample rate. 1 / `sample_rate` events will be sent.
    - `max_concurrent_batches`: the maximum number of concurrent threads sending events.
    - `max_batch_size`: the maximum number of events to batch before sendinga.
    - `send_frequency`: how long to wait before sending a batch of events, in seconds.
    - `block_on_send`: if true, block when send queue fills. If false, drop
            events until there's room in the queue
    - `block_on_response`: if true, block when the response queue fills. If
            false, drop response objects.
    - `transmission_impl`: if set, override the default transmission implementation (for example, TornadoTransmission)

    --------

    **Configuration recommendations**:

    **For gunicorn**, use a [`post_worker_init` config hook](http://docs.gunicorn.org/en/stable/settings.html#post-worker-init)
    to initialize Honeycomb:

        # conf.py
        import logging
        import os

        def post_worker_init(worker):
            logging.info(f'libhoney initialization in process pid {os.getpid()}')
            libhoney.init(writekey="YOUR_WRITE_KEY", dataset="dataset_name")

    Then start gunicorn with the `-c` option:

        gunicorn -c /path/to/conf.py
