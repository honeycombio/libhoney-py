class Client(object):
    '''Instantiate a libhoney Client that can prepare and send events to Honeycomb.

    Note that libhoney Clients initialize a number of threads to handle
    sending payloads to Honeycomb. Client initialization is heavy, and re-use
    of Client objects is encouraged. If you must use multiple clients, consider
    reducing `max_concurrent_batches` to reduce the number of threads per client.

    When using a Client instance, you need to use the Client to generate Event and Builder
    objects. Examples:

    ```
    c = Client(writekey="mywritekey", dataset="mydataset")
    ev = c.new_event()
    ev.add_field("foo", "bar")
    ev.send()
    ```

    ```
    c = Client(writekey="mywritekey", dataset="mydataset")
    b = c.new_builder()
    b.add_field("foo", "bar")
    ev = b.new_event()
    ev.send()
    ```

    To ensure that events are flushed before program termination, you should explicitly call `close()`
    on your Client instance.

    Args:

    - `writekey`: the authorization key for your team on Honeycomb. Find your team
            write key at [https://ui.honeycomb.io/account](https://ui.honeycomb.io/account)
    - `dataset`: the name of the default dataset to which to write
    - `sample_rate`: the default sample rate. 1 / `sample_rate` events will be sent.
    - `max_concurrent_batches`: the maximum number of concurrent threads sending events.
    - `max_batch_size`: the maximum number of events to batch before sending.
    - `send_frequency`: how long to wait before sending a batch of events, in seconds.
    - `block_on_send`: if true, block when send queue fills. If false, drop
            events until there's room in the queue
    - `block_on_response`: if true, block when the response queue fills. If
            false, drop response objects.
    - `transmission_impl`: if set, override the default transmission implementation
            (for example, TornadoTransmission)
    - `user_agent_addition`: if set, its contents will be appended to the
            User-Agent string, separated by a space. The expected format is
            product-name/version, eg "myapp/1.0"
